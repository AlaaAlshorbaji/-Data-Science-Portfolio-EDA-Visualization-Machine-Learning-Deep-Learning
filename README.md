## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on structured data  
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn  
- Implement a neural network model for classification tasks using TensorFlow/Keras

## 📌 Notebook Details

### 1. 🧪 `EDA1_Titanic.ipynb`
- Loads Titanic dataset and explores:
  - Missing values
  - Feature distributions
  - Correlations and survival patterns
- Techniques: `.isnull()`, `.describe()`, `groupby`, pie charts, bar plots, heatmaps

---

### 2. 📊 `Data_Visualization_with_Matplotlib_ipynb_txt.ipynb`
- Covers a variety of Matplotlib charts:
  - Line plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots
- Customizes plots with titles, labels, legends, styles

---

### 3. 🧠 `SKLEARN.ipynb`
- Implements machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines
- Uses `train_test_split`, `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`
- Includes preprocessing with `StandardScaler` and performance comparison

---

### 4. 🤖 `Full_project.ipynb`
- Deep learning model using `TensorFlow/Keras`
- Data normalization, model building with `Dense` layers
- Compiled with Adam optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy`
- Trained with `.fit()`, evaluated on test data
- Visualization of training loss and accuracy
